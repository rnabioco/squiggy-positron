  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: Nanopore sequencing current signal data can be
                  'basecalled' into sequence information or analysed directly,
                  with the capacity to identify diverse molecular features, such
                  as DNA/RNA base modifications and secondary structures.
                  However, raw signal data is large and complex, and there is a
                  need for improved visualization strategies to facilitate
                  signal analysis, exploration and tool development. RESULTS:
                  Squigualiser (Squiggle visualiser) is a toolkit for intuitive,
                  interactive visualization of sequence-aligned signal data,
                  which currently supports both DNA and RNA sequencing data from
                  Oxford Nanopore Technologies instruments. Squigualiser is
                  compatible with a wide range of alternative signal-alignment
                  software packages and enables visualization of both
                  signal-to-read and signal-to-reference aligned data at
                  single-base resolution. Squigualiser generates an interactive
                  signal browser view (HTML file), in which the user can
                  navigate across a genome/transcriptome region and customize
                  the display. Multiple independent reads are integrated into a
                  'signal pileup' format and different datasets can be displayed
                  as parallel tracks. Although other methods exist, Squigualiser
                  provides the community with a software package purpose-built
                  for raw signal data visualization, incorporating a range of
                  new and existing features into a unified platform.
                  AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Squigualiser is an
                  open-source package under an MIT licence:
                  https://github.com/hiruna72/squigualiser. The software was
                  developed using Python 3.8 and can be installed with pip or
                  bioconda or executed directly using prebuilt binaries provided
                  with each release.},

  abstract     = {MOTIVATION: Oxford Nanopore Technologies recently adopted the
                  POD5 file format for storing raw nanopore sequencing data. The
                  information stored in these files provides detailed insights
                  into the sequencing features and enhances the understanding of
                  raw nanopore data. However, the process of visualizing the
                  data can be cumbersome, especially for users without
                  programming skills. To address this issue, we developed the
                  pod5Viewer, a GUI application for inspecting POD5 files.
                  RESULTS: The pod5Viewer offers straightforward access to raw
                  sequencing data and associated metadata in POD5 files. It
                  includes functionalities for viewing, plotting, and exporting
                  individual reads. Designed with user-friendliness in mind, the
                  pod5Viewer is easy to install and use, making it suitable for
                  users with all technical backgrounds. AVAILABILITY AND
                  IMPLEMENTATION: The pod5Viewer is available as open source
                  from the pod5Viewer Github repository
                  (https://github.com/dietvin/pod5Viewer).},
